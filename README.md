Ask admins to add you in the backend or frontend team. Happy contributing.

From the Admins - 

There will be different teams, each team has it's own channel: frontend, backend. 
Each team will be responsible of splitting itself into sub-teams and work under the leadership of a member who will manage the subteams of that team and assign tasks.
